	  Welcome to Yet Another JSON Library (YAJL)
	
          ## Why does the world need another C library for parsing JSON?  
	
	  Good question.  In a review of current C JSON parsing libraries I was 
	  unable to find one that satisfies my requirements.  Those are, 
	  0. written in C
	  1. portable
	  2. robust -- as close to "crash proof" as possible
	  3. data representation independent
	  4. fast
	  5. generates verbose, useful error messages including context of where
	     the error occurs in the input text.
	  6. can parse JSON data off a stream, incrementally
	  7. simple to use
	  8. tiny
